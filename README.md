***A/B Testing for Email Marketing Campaign***

**What is A/B Testing**:

A/B testing is a controlled experiment that compares two versions of a variable (e.g., webpage, email, or app feature) to determine which performs better based on a specific metric, such as conversion rate or engagement. It is widely used in digital marketing, product design, and user experience optimization to make data-driven decisions that improve outcomes.

**Objective**:
The dataset I am using for this project is the Marketing A/B Testing dataset from Kaggle. While many datasets are often explored for learning purposes, my goal is to analyze this dataset by defining hypothetical business requirements. This approach will facilitate a more focused analysis and provide a clearer understanding of the data and the appropriate hypothesis testing methods to apply.

**Business Requirements**:
A marketing team wants to evaluate the effectiveness of their ad campaigns by analyzing user behavior data. They aim to understand how ad exposure and timing impact conversion rates to optimize their strategies for better results.

Three business requirements mentioned by the client:

1. Evaluate Ad Effectiveness Compare the conversion rates between the "ad" and "no ad" groups to determine if the ad campaign successfully influences user behavior. This will help assess whether running ads leads to a significant improvement in conversions.

2. Analyze Impact of Ad Exposure Examine whether the number of ads shown (total ads) has a measurable effect on conversion rates. Understanding this relationship can reveal the optimal ad frequency to maximize effectiveness without overwhelming users.

3. Identify Optimal Ad Timing Analyze how conversion rates fluctuate based on the most ads day and most ads hour. Identifying the best-performing times can guide when to allocate resources for maximum impact.
